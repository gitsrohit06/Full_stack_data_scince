    "Be clear, consistent, and simple in your planning and terminology. Prioritize important sections and remove ambiguous sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Interactivity\n",
    "Make the documentation interactive by adding sample codes and test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Versioning\n",
    "Versioning helps keep the functionality intact while adapting to changes. It also helps manage code changes and revert back to older versions if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Error handling\n",
    "Handle errors gracefully and return HTTP response codes that indicate the error's nature. This helps maintainers identify the cause of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Security\n",
    "Build the API with user data in mind and treat users more than just data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Authentication and authorization\n",
    "Verify user identity through authentication and ensure users have the necessary permissions to access resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Documentation tools\n",
    "Consider using tools like Swagger to automatically document the API and record changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Audience\n",
    "Cater to both experienced and beginner audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data transfer\n",
    "Support JSON as a data transfer format by setting the Content-Type to application/json.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### HTTP response codes\n",
    "Use HTTP response status codes to indicate whether a request has been completed successfully. "
